    <p>            Summer went away
            Still, the yearning stays
            I play it cool with the best of them
            I wait patiently
            He's gonna notice me
            It's okay, we're the best of friends
            <a href="">Anyway</a>
        
            I hear it in your voice
            You're smoking with your boys
            I touch my phone as if it's your face
            I didn't choose this town
            I <a href="">dream</a> of getting out
            There's just one who could make me stay
            All my days

            From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
            I waited ages to see you there
            I search the party of better bodies
            Just to learn that you never cared
            <a href="">You're on your own, kid</a>
            You always have been

            I see the great escape
            So long, Daisy May
            I picked the petals, he loves me not
            Something different bloomed
            <a href="">Writing</a> in my room
            I play my songs in the parking lot
            I'll run away 

            From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
            I waited ages to see you there
            I search the party of better bodies
            Just to learn that you never cared
            <a href="">You're on your own, kid</a>
            You always have been
            
            From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
            I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
            I hosted parties and starved my body
            Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
            The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
            My friends from home don't know what to say
            I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
            And I saw something they can't take away
            'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
            Everything you lose is a step you take
            So make the friendship bracelets
            Take the moment and taste it
            You've got no reason to be afraid
            <a href="">You're on your own, kid</a>
            <a href="">Yeah, you can face this</a>
            You're on your own, kid
            You always have been</p>
