In this project, I have learned:

  <li>What a json server is, and how to create a temporary one using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</li>
  <li>What 'fetch' does and what a promise is</li>
  <li>How to change the html content using .innerHTML/li>
  <li>Javscript event 'focusout'/li>
</ul>
Merry Christmas ^^
