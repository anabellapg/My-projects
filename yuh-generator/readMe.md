This is the first project in which I have implemented javascript into my code. I have learned:

<ul>
  <li>How to use capture methods on the DOM (querySelector)</li>
  <li>How to activate basic events on js</li>
  <li>How to add and remove html classes (classList) </li>
  <li>How to use "data-" and "audio" tags on html </li>
</ul>

Thank u, next!
